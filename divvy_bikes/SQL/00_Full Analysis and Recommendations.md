**Monthly Ridership Pattern**

- The decline in ridership is likely due to seasonal effects of the cold winter months making cycling less appealing. With temperatures warming up in March, casual ridership is starting to pick up.

**Key Findings**: 
Casual users are more sensitive to changes in weather patterns than annual members. This is possibly due to casual users riding for leisure as opposed to riding as a last-mile connection to their place of work.

**Rideable Type Usage by User type**

-  Both user types completed more rides using Electric bikes than Classic bikes.
Casual users had a stronger preference for Electric scooters than members.

**Key Findings:**  
No significant difference in preference for rideable type between the two user types

**Trip Duration Distribution by User Type**

-  94.5% of trips made by members are completed within 30 minutes, with 99.4% of trips ending within 1 hour.
-  83.3% of trips made by casual users are completed within 30 minutes, with 94.6% of trips ending within 1 hour.

**Key Findings:**
Casual users are more likely to take longer trips than members, this might be a result of the day pass option offered to casual users, allowing unlimited 3 hour ride time.

**Comparison of the most popular start and end stations**

-  The 10 most popular start stations are exactly the same as end stations for both members (in green) and casual users (in blue).  
-  Popular stations for casual users are along the coast line and have recreational areas such as parks or attractions nearby. 
-  Popular stations for members are located in the city centre and close to transit hubs, or school campuses. 

**Key Findings:**
Casual users ride recreationally along parks or places of attraction, while members likely ride as a first/last-mile connection to the public transportation network.

**Daily ridership by User type**

-  Ridership for casual users pick up towards the end of the week (i.e. Friday, Saturday, Sunday)
Ridership for members peak over weekdays and dip towards the weekends (i.e. Saturday & Sunday) 

**Key Findings:**
- Members likely use Divvy as part of their daily commute to their workplace, which would explain the dip over the weekends. 
- Casual users' rise in usage towards the end of the week aligns with previous findings of bikes being used recreationally.

# Top 3 recommendations based on analysis
Based on the key findings established earlier, the majority of casual users ride recreationally over the weekends, with ridership peaking in warmer months of June and July before starting to decline in the fall. 

**Recommendation 1: Create a tiered subscription plans based on usage**

This recommendation aims to create a tiered subscription model that allows customers to pick a plan that best suits their needs, instead of the current flat pricing model for subscriptions. For example, as casual users are more likely to ride over the weekends, a Weekend-only plan can include discounted rates over the weekends, but full rates on the weekdays. This subscription plan can be priced at a lower rate than the current flat pricing model to incentivise casual members to subscribe. Offering short term subscriptions (e.g. 1 month plan and 3 months plan) at a premium can also capture the surge in casual user ridership over the warm summer months, with the heightened demand continuing into fall. 

**Recommendation 2: Increase adoption of cycling in students**

This recommendation aims to increase student adoption of cycling as their first/last mile connection in their commute. One option is to offer a student subscription plan at a discounted rate. 

Among members, the University Ave & 57th St station is the 9th most popular ending station. With more than 20 higher education institutions in Chicago, this shows the untapped potential of converting more students into members. By developing the habit of cycling as a student, it can build brand loyalty and extend customer lifetime value as students enter into the workforce with the habit of cycling as part of their daily commute. 

**Recommendation 3: Out-of-Home (OOH) Advertising**

This recommendation aims to increase casual users' adoption of cycling as a mode of transport for daily commute. Earlier analysis revealed almost 95% of memberâ€™s trips ended within 30 minutes, with popular stations being within walking distance to a transit hub. OOH advertising can be placed strategically within a 30 minute bike ride from popular transit hubs and stations, with advertising content reminding users their destination is just a short bike ride away. These advertising can also be placed at popular stations among casual users as identified in the earlier analysis.

Advertising content can be varied to appeal to users from different backgrounds. For example, it can display content about the reduction in carbon footprint of an average member who cycles as part of their daily commute. This will appeal to the growing community of environmentally conscious consumers looking to play their part. It can also appeal to the health conscious and those looking to keep fit by displaying content about the benefits of regular exercise and the estimated calories burnt by cycling to nearby stations.
