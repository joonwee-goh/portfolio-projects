## Documentation of Cleaning Process

**Cleaning Process**

Used Power Query Editor in Excel to create a data cleaning template to apply to each month by changing the data source step. 

**Added**: 

- trip_duration column to calculate the difference between start time and end time of each trip.
- day_of_week column to determine which day of the week the trip was made. Ranges from 1 to 7, with 1 = Monday and 7 = Sunday.

**Removed**:

- Trips shorter than 60 seconds, potential false starts or users trying to re-dock a bike.
- Trips longer than 24 hours, considered lost or stolen as per Divvyâ€™s user policy.
- Duplicates in ride_id column, ensuring every row is unique

**Changed**:

- Exported clean worksheets into a .CSV file for data import into BigQuery (SQL) for manipulation
