## Divvy Bikes Project 

This folder contains materials created for my Google Data Analytics capstone project. It documents my thought process throughout the phases of data cleaning, using SQL to query the relational database system (used BigQuery), and finally presenting the insights through data visualisations in Tableau.  

## Data Source
As several months of the original raw data files exceed GitHub's 100mb limit, I have provided a truncated sample dataset limited to the first 500 rows for each month. This will allow you to view a snapshot of the data transformation process. 

Samples of both raw and cleaned data can be found in the **data** folder in both files are in CSV format 

Data source came from Divvy Bikes public dataset https://divvybikes.com/system-data
