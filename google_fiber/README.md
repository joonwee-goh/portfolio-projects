# Google Fiber Project

### 📁 Overview
This folder contains materials creeated for my Google Business Intelligence capstone project. It documents my thought process of creating an effective BI dashboard by first understanding stakeholder requirements for the project, analysing the data set provided and culminating in building a dashboard that not only answers stakeholder questions but also empowers them to to make data-driven decisions in the long term. 

- **Business Task:** Improve customer experience by exploring reasons behind repeated customer calls to Google Fiber's customer service team, in support of the customer service team's aim of increasing first-call resolution for all customers across the 3 markets.
- Dataset used: Fictitious dataset provided by the course, loaded into Excel for compilation then exported to Tableau.

### 📈 Key Insights

- 📌 **One In Four Customers Were Repeat Callers**
  -  Across all markets, roughly one in four (23.8%) customers had to call more than once to resolve the issue they were facing. 
  
- 📌 **Issue Type 2 and 5 Were The Leading Issues Customer Faced**
  -   This highlights key areas the Customer Service Team can focus on to effectively reduce total repeat call volumes by addressing potential knowledge gaps when using the service.

- 📌 **Customers In Market 3 Were Most Likely To Be Repeat Callers**
  -   30.9% of customers from Market 3 called more than once, with the leading issue being Type 2. This figure lies above the average repeat call rates of 18.45% in both Market 1 and 2, suggesting there may be gaps in resolving customer issues in Market 3.

### 💡 What I Learned

- Worked on understanding stakeholder's requirements, in order to create a product that enables my stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.
- Improved on creating aesthetic, interactive dashboards consisting of filters and different charts in Tableau.

### ✅ Next Steps

- I am looking to expand my knowledge of available BI tools such as PowerBI and data pipeline tools such as Apache in order to develop data pipelines that can automate the ETL process and feed into a Business Intelligence tools for monthly reporting or even handling of live data feeding into a real-time dashboard.
- Continue to develop my skills in creating interactive and powerful dashboards in Tableau
